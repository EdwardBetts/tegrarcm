.SH NAME
tegrarcm \- tegra firmware download utility
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B tegrarcm
[
.I options
]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This program is used to send code to a Tegra device in recovery mode.
It does not supported locked devices with an encrypted boot key, only
open devices such as the ventana or cardhu reference boards.  It is
not capable of flashing firmware to a device, but can be used to
download firmware that is then capable of flashing.  For example in
ChromeOS tegrarcm is used to download a special build of u-boot to the
target Tegra device with a payload that it then flashes to the boot
device.

.SS How to use
.IP \(em
Connect a USB cable from your development system to your Tegra
device.  You will either need a USB A to A cable or A to micro B
depending on the target board.
.IP \(em
Find the appropriate BCT file for your board.  For reference boards,
BCT files can be found in the L4T distribution from NVIDIA.
.IP \(em
Build some firmware for your device (such as u-boot)
.IP \(em
Run tegrarcm to download the firmware

.SH COMMANDS
.TP
.B readbct
Read the BCT from the target device and write it to \fIbctfile\fP.

.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.B \-\-bct \fIbctfile\fP
Specify the BCT file to download to the Tegra device.  This file contains
memory configuation information for the board.  BCT files can be
obtained through the NVIDIA L4T distribution or generated with
cbootimage and a proper configuration file.
.TP
.B \-\-bootloader \fIblfile\fP
Specify the bootloader file to download to the Tegra device.  This is
the firmware file that will be downloaded and executed.
.TP
.B \-\-loadaddr \fIloadaddr\fP
Specify the address the bootloader will be loaded at.  This should be
specified in hex and is typically 0x108000 for a Tegra20 device or
0x80108000 for a Tegra30 or later device.
.TP
.B \-\-entryaddr \fIentryaddr\fP
Specify the entry address that control will be passed to after the
firmware is loaded.  This should be specified in hex.  If this option
is omitted it is assumed to be the same as the load address.
.TP
.B \-\-version
Print the version number and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-help
Print help text and exit.
.TP
.B \-\-miniloader \fImlfile\fP
Read the miniloader from the specified file instead of using the
built-in one.
.TP
.B \-\-miniloader_entry \fImlentry\fP
Specify the entry address of the miniloader.

.SH EXAMPLES
